## What is AirSafe?

AirSafe is a network security tool designed to scan for and identify devices on your local Wi-Fi network.  
**Its primary function is to help you detect potentially hidden or unknown devices, such as spy cameras, in environments like Airbnb rentals.** 
  
Through a deep scan, AirSafe lists connected devices, assigns a trust score, and helps you gauge your accommodationâ€™s security. Its added value lies in offering a graphical and highly accessible interface, **<ins>making it easy for non-technical users to understand and act on the results.</ins>**


## Requirements

AirSafe requires **Nmap**, a widely-used and powerful open-source network scanning utility.  
You must have Nmap installed on your system for AirSafe to function correctly.
