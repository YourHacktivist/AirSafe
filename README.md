## What is AirSafe?

AirSafe is a simple tool that helps you check for any hidden or unusual devices on your home Wi-Fi network. It's like a security guard for your network, scanning for things that shouldn't be there, like hidden cameras or other unknown devices. It gives each device a "trust score" so you can easily see if it's safe.

## Requirements

AirSafe needs a special program called **Nmap** to work. Think of Nmap as a powerful magnifying glass that AirSafe uses to look at your network. You **must** install Nmap first.

-   You can download and install Nmap from here: [https://nmap.org/download.html](https://nmap.org/download.html)

## Usage

AirSafe is currently only available for **Windows computers**.

### How to get it

1.  Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/YourHacktivist/AirSafe/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
2.  Download the file named `AirSafe-win.exe`.
3.  Double-click the `AirSafe.exe` file to start the program.

### How to use it

1.  Make sure you have **Nmap** installed on your computer.
2.  Open `AirSafe.exe`.
3.  AirSafe will automatically start scanning your network. You don't have to do anything else.
4.  When the scan is finished, you will see a list of all the devices connected to your Wi-Fi, along with their trust scores.

## Windows Security Warning

When you open AirSafe for the first time, Windows might show a security warning. This is a normal message that appears for new programs that aren't widely known yet. It's safe to ignore.

To continue, click on **More info**, then click **Run anyway**.
